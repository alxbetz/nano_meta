goEnrichmentxGenes: 
left join of per contrast gene table and GO enrichment table :

GO.ID	Gene Ontology ID that the gene 'gid' is annotated with
gid	Gene ID
eid	expression set ID from GEO(gene expression omnibus)
contrast	contrast used in limma to determine fold change
Term	Title of the GO Term
Annotated	How many genes are annotated with this term in this organism
Significant	How many of the annotated genes are differentially expressed
Expected	How many genes are expected to be differentially expressed in this group
elimKS	p-value of the elimination Kolmogorov Smirnov test for ontology enrichment
medianFC	median fold change observed for a gene with this GO term in this contrast
meanFC	mean fold change observed for a gene with this GO term in this contrast
minFC	minimum fold change observed for a gene with this GO term in this contrast
maxFC	maximum fold change observed for a gene with this GO term in this contrast
FC	Fold change for this gene in this contrast
species	The species under consideration


topTable:
logFC log fold change
AveExpr	Average expression value 
t	moderated t-test value
P.Value	uncorrected p-value
adj.P.Val	benjamini-hochberg adjusted p-value
B	moderated B-statistic
locusID	locus ID
